## Online Quiz Application with NextJS, Node.js & MongoDB

**Node.js and Next.js Full Stack Application**

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack web application with a Node.js backend and a React.js frontend. The backend handles API requests and data processing, while the frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from the official website.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager is included with Node.js.
- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command, replacing `<username>` and `<repo-name>` with the appropriate values:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
   ```

4. Navigate into the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

## Installing Dependencies

Both the backend and frontend have their own dependencies. You need to install them separately.

### Backend (Node.js)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Frontend (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Backend

1. Ensure you are in the backend directory.
2. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5500` or a similar port.

### Frontend

1. Ensure you are in the frontend directory.
2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
